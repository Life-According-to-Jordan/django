## Steps To Start Working With Django

1. First, download Miniconda or [Conda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as it is commonly refered to. Conda is a smaller version of Anaconda and allows you to work within terminal with the conda environment. Run the shell script in your terminal and install conda. 

2. Second, I'll be working in the text editor, [Atom](https://atom.io/). You should download this in order to follow along.

3. Third, in your preferences in Atom, you'll want to install "Platformio Ide Terminal" v.2.8.1. Once you have this installed, in the packages section of Atom, you can add terminal to your text editor transforming it into an IDE.

4. Then, once you have all of the previous packages downloaded and set up, you'll want to download Django. Simply run "pip install django" in your command line and your system should download django. 

5. In the terminal inside atom, you can run python manage.py runserver




#### I had to stop for now, but I intend to continue working with django very soon 5-1-2018, Jordan
